## Lightning Talks

Each lightning talk is designed to take ~15 minutes to present and includes 1-2 quick hands-on demos. Each talk consists of a Markdown file for source content and a PPTX file in the [latest GitHub release][release-latest]. Each talk also includes a link to a YouTube train-the-trainer video showing an example of the many ways you can deliver this content for your audience.
